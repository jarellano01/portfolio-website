        <p>Meeting Meter is a simple front end JavaScript Web App that was inspired from constant pointless meetings that
          often seemed to have no purpose. One day, I decided to create Meeting Meter just to test out my new JavaScript
          skills that I gain from the UCLA Bootcamp (early in the course), and this what came out of it.
        <p>Remember this is all front end JS only so neither the counter nor the table will not persist if the page is
          refreshed. The counter will also pause if you switch tabs or hide your browser on a phone.</p>
        <p>None the less, I think my point was made when I first presented this app at the next meeting I forced to go to.</p>
