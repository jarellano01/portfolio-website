                <p>Remember this is all front end JS only so neither the counter nor the table will not persist if the
                    page is
                    refreshed. The counter will also pause if you switch tabs or hide your browser on a phone.</p>
                <p>None the less, I think my point was made when I first presented this app at the next meeting I forced
                    to go to.</p>
